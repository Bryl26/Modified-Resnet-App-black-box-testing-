              Rice diseases pose a significant threat to global food security, particularly in rice-dependent countries like the Philippines. Traditional disease detection methods rely on manual inspection, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. This study presents an advanced approach to detecting multiple rice diseases using a modified ResNet50 convolutional neural network (CNN). Unlike previous models that classified fewer than ten diseases, this research enhances ResNet50 to classify 14 distinct rice diseases, optimizing its architecture for improved feature extraction and classification accuracy.

The proposed modified ResNet50 architecture introduces adjustments in its convolutional layers, feature map transitions, and classification layers to enhance efficiency and accuracy. Key modifications include restructuring the bottleneck blocks, optimizing feature scaling, and replacing the fully connected (FC) layer with a Global Average Pooling (GAP) layer, reducing overfitting while maintaining high classification performance. Transfer learning was employed to refine the model, leveraging pre-trained weights to improve accuracy with a limited dataset.

Experimental results demonstrated that the modified ResNet50 outperformed standard deep learning models, achieving a 99% classification accuracy, surpassing MobileNet (87%), EfficientNet (91%), and other CNN-based architectures. The model effectively identified diseases like Bacterial Leaf Blight, Rice Blast, and Tungro Virus, overcoming challenges in distinguishing visually similar diseases. This study highlights the potential of deep learning in precision agriculture, offering an efficient, scalable, and highly accurate tool for automated rice disease detection, ultimately benefiting farmers, researchers, and agricultural stakeholders.
